Termination is a fundamental topic in computer science. While classical results state the undecidability of various termination problems, automated methods have successfully been developed that prove termination or non-termination in practical cases. Research in termination analysis offers many challenges both in theory (mathematical logic, proof theory) and practice (software development, formal methods).

This portal aims to provide the research community with up-to-date information about the field of termination analysis. The main sections are [People](/:Category:People "wikilink") (information about researchers in termination analysis), [News](/:Category:News "wikilink") (information about events and new publications), [Tools](/:Category:Tools "wikilink") (information about tools for automated termination analysis), and [References](/:Category:Bibtex "wikilink") (publications related to termination analysis). Additionally, the portal provides information about past and future [workshops](/WST "wikilink") and [competitions](/Termination_Competition "wikilink").

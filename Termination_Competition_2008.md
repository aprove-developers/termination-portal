From 2008 onwards, the competition will be ongoing: submission of new problems and provers is possible anytime via...

-   [Termination Competition Execution Platform](http://termcomp.uibk.ac.at/termcomp/) ([how to submit](http://lists.lri.fr/pipermail/termtools/2008-October/000511.html))

Still, there will be certain deadlines where all data is collected and a report is produced. Upcoming deadlines are:

-   (passed) 1 November 2008 (report will be presented at Workshop on Termination in June 2009)
-   new execution platform will be available for testing shortly before WST09 (that is, in May)
-   future deadlines will be discussed during WST09

The [Termination Problem Data Base 5.0] [1](http://dev.aspsimon.org/projects/termcomp/downloads/) is used for the competition 2008.

While implementation of the execution platform is handled by the Host of the competition, here is a separate page (a wishlist) for design issues: [Termination_Competition_Platform](/Termination_Competition_Platform "wikilink").

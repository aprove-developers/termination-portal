How to Contribute
=================

If you do research on termination, then consider contributing to this web site.

-   to add or edit pages, you need an account. You can [register for a new account](/Special:RequestAccount "wikilink") and after confirmation of your mail address the administrators decide whether to accept your request based on the credentials you provided. In order to successfully register your account please add some hints why you are interested in termination (publications, contact data, ...).

-   before you add information, determine its "most logical" place (consider where you'd search for it).

-   only submit information that you really "own", that is, that concerns your work directly.

-   avoid duplication of information (provide a reference/link instead).

-   if you post a news entry please keep it short. You can link to some site containing more information.

We want to have a domain name for this web site. What is your preference? Vote here

-   termination-portal.org

-   termination-portal.info

-   termination-live.org (by analogy to satlive.org)

-   terminationlive.(org|info) (registrateable via www.verio.com)

-   termination.at

or extend the list (but check that the name is free). (everything like termination.\* seems already taken)

Peter: I like termination-portal as it is descriptive. (Carsten Otto thinks the same.)

Carsten Fuhs: Another proposal might be <i>termination.at</i> (still free according to whois). The name is quite catchy and short, and I do not think that using a "national" domain name (here: Austria) would be a big problem. Does anyone know how hard it is to get an .at-domain?

F. Blanqui: I vote for termination-portal.org.

Andreas: I added <b>termination-portal.info</b> and <b>terminationlive.(org|info)</b> but for myself i like <i>terminationlive.org</i> because the analogy to satlive.org and \*live\* means maybe state of the art ...

C. Fuhs: I would also be fine with termination-portal.org.

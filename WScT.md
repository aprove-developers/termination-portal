Goals
-----

Termination is an important and difficult problem. Many methods and criteria have been developed, and they are being used in various programs (termination provers), see for instance the international [Termination_Competition](/Termination_Competition "wikilink") .

These programs are more and more complex and are being applied on larger and larger input systems. For these tools to be used in the certification of critical systems and proof assistants, their results must be certified.

The Workshops on Certified Termination aim to bring together researchers working in the field for a discussion of current results, as well as directions of further research and implementation.

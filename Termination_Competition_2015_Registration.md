General
-------

Registration process is like it was last year. In short,

-   get a starexec account, upload your solver
-   send email to J. Waldmann with:
    -   categories that you want to enter,
    -   and for each category, the starexec IDs of your solver and config.

Compare [Termination Competition 2014 Registration](/Termination_Competition_2014_Registration "wikilink")

Please do send in solver/config Ids, even if they refer to preliminary versions, or last year's, as I (J.W.) will start testing.

These IDs for solver and config might get published even before competition. If you want to keep the solvers secret for now, then put them in a private space and add me to this space.

I will make available publically some results of pre-competition test runs (on random, small subsets): <http://nfa.imn.htwk-leipzig.de/termcomp-devel/competitions>

Here are some [strange outputs of test runs](/Termination_Competition_2015_Bugs "wikilink")

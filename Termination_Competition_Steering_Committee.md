title: Termination Competition Steering Committee
permalink: /Termination_Competition_Steering_Committee/
---

The basic ideas are:

-   one research group hosts (implements, executes) the competition
-   a committee, representing all research groups, influences the design and the running of the competition.

Currently, the Competition is hosted by the Computational Logic Research Group of the University of Innsbruck, Austria (organized by Simon Bailey and René Thiemann).

The Competition Committee currently consists of Jürgen Giesl, Frederic Mesnard, Albert Rubio (Chair), René Thiemann, and Johannes Waldmann.

The steering committee assembled on June 3rd, 2009, during the Workshop on Termination in Leipzig.

(13-Oct-2008) <http://lists.lri.fr/pipermail/termtools/2008-October/000519.html>

YES.

-   Will there be a SRS-certified category?

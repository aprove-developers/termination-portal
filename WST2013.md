Overview
--------

The Workshop on Termination ([WST](/WST "wikilink")) traditionally brings together, in an informal setting, researchers interested in all aspects of termination, whether this interest be practical or theoretical, primary or derived. The workshop also provides a ground for cross-fertilisation of ideas from term rewriting and from the different programming language communities. The friendly atmosphere enables fruitful exchanges leading to joint research and subsequent publications.

The 13th Workshop on Termination will be held from August 29 to 31, 2013, at the [Centro Residenziale Universitario di Bertinoro (Italy)](http://www.ceub.it/default.asp?id=346) .

It will be a joint workshop, together with the [3rd International Workshop on Foundational and Practical Aspects of Resource Analysis](http://fopara2013.cs.unibo.it/). The sessions of WST and FOPARA will be interleaved, this way facilitating the interaction between the two communities.

Invited Speaker: Byron Cook on Beyond Termination
-------------------------------------------------

Abstract: So we can prove program termination. Now what? In this talk I will discuss the development of tools that build on termination proving techniques.

Bio: [Prof. Dr. Byron Cook](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/bycook/) is Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, and Professor at University College London. Byron has worked in the past on Haskell, hardware modelling and verification, biological systems modelling and verification SAT/SMT, symbolic software model checking, temporal logics, and termination proving.

Topics
------

The 13th International Workshop on Termination welcomes contributions on all aspects of termination and complexity analysis. Contributions from the imperative, constraint, functional, logic, and concurrent programming communities, and papers investigating applications of complexity or termination (for example in program transformation or theorem proving) are particularly welcome. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

-   Termination of programs
-   Termination of rewriting
-   Termination analysis of transition systems
-   Complexity of programs
-   Complexity of rewriting
-   Implicit computational complexity
-   Implementation of termination and complexity analysis methods
-   SAT and SMT solving for (non-)termination analysis
-   Certification of termination and complexity proofs
-   Termination orders, well-founded orders, and reduction orders
-   Termination methods for theorem provers
-   Strong and weak normalization of lambda calculi
-   Termination analysis for different language paradigms
-   Invariants for termination proving
-   Challenging termination problems
-   Applications to program transformation and compilation
-   Comparison and classification of termination methods
-   Non-termination and loop detection
-   Termination in distributed systems
-   Proof methods for liveness and fairness
-   Well-quasi-order theory
-   Ordinal notations and subrecursive hierarchies

Submission
----------

Submissions are short papers/extended abstract which should not exceed 5 pages. There will be no formal reviewing. Accepted papers will be made available electronically at the workshop.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the [submission page](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wst2013). Final versions should be created using LaTeX and the [LIPIcs style file](http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors.tgz).

Registration, Travel
--------------------

[Joint FOPARA+WST online registration](http://www.ceub.it/default.asp?id_c=161&id=436)

Participants are expected to arrive on August 28th evening, and indeed the bus to Bertinoro will leave Bologna at around 19.00 that day. So, your flight or train should arrive at Bologna at 18.30 or before.

The Workshop ends on August 31st afternoon. The exact schedule for the bus to Bologna is not yet fixed but, again, participants should book flights or trains leaving Bologna at 17.00 or after.

In the 17.00-19.00 slots there are many flights to-from European cities (Amsterdam, Paris, Frankfurt, Munich, London, Madrid, etc).

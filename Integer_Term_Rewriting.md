title: Integer Term Rewriting

The main idea of ITRSs is to add pre-defined constructors for integers (the integers themselves) and Booleans (true / false) and arithmetic, relational and Boolean functions like

`+, -, *,/ ,%, >, >=, <, &&, ||, !, ... `

to conventional TRSs using the *innermost* rewrite strategy. To this aim it is necessary to extend the XTC format by the ability to represent pre-defined semantics for function symbols. Not only ITRSs, but also other extensions with pre-defined functions can be represented using this extension of the XTC format. A formal definition of ITRSs and their evaluation can be found in [this paper](http://verify.rwth-aachen.de/giesl/papers/idp-distribute.pdf).
